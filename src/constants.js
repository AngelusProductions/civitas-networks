            government wants to fund deployment. Yet no one has developed a plan for providing such
            service to the smaller communities throughout the country since it is not a lucrative
            proposition. Civitas Networks believes otherwise. It believes all communities should have
            access to the latest technology and its mission is to focus entirely on those communities being
            neglected and offer them a unique solution not readily available.
             Civitas’s unique approach to 5G fills the need for community’s looking for privacy,
            security, and a more useful network based on their needs on not the MNOs,
             5G private networks will improve a community’s way of life and bring new sources of
            revenue,
             Better looking and fitting equipment will ease deployment issues, enhancing the value
            of the community,
             Civitas works closely with the community to ensure their 5G and smart community
            needs are part of the equation.`

            system that protects the interests of the community in terms of visibility and services, while
            increasing municipal revenue and becoming a central element of their Smart City development

            content: `What is needed is a deeper understanding of the community’s goals, and then building a
            system around them. Civitas’ s customized, flexible Open Source 5G based wireless network
            supplies the community with not only reliable, secure, and high-speed data, but a whole host
            of sensors which enable the community to better understand their environment and adapt to
            the changing needs of their world.
            
            By employing a network of connected 5G transmitters along with IOT based sensors, the
            network not only brings a whole host of new services, but also collects and analyzes data for
            the community to use to improve infrastructure, public utilities, services, and more. The digital
            infrastructure of a smart city sets the stage for a network of partnerships all focused on one
            goal: Creating a smarter city. The result is an urban center that not only leverages technology to
            improve its own operations, but one that connects its citizens, businesses, and nonprofits in
            ways they’ve never experienced before. For example, retail market research and planning
            currently leans heavily on surveys. With a community-based sensor system, the information is
            already known. Community leaders can download and sort the data as needed.
            Our Focus is to support the Community, provide actionable data and measurable benefits,
            manage risk and resiliency, and enhance service.`

            designed for the present and future needs of the host community, not just for benefit of the
            wireless operator. Civitas custom designs the entire system around the growth plan and goals
            of the community. As a single source provider of optional unlicensed network services and
            connectivity, smart pole hosted sensor and 5G technology, robust security services, and data
            governance models, Civitas custom designs the entire system based around the growth plan
            and goals of the community. Some of the benefits for the community include offering the
            latest in 5G technology, advanced high efficiency lighting, and environmental sensors with little
            or no community investment. The community will also realize an increase in revenue,
            estimated to be as much as 7-10% year-over-year.
            Civitas works hand-in-hand with the community to help navigate the entire process. It begins
            with an analysis of the community’s growth plans, review the technical requirements, and
            navigate the complex process to get the Smart City technology needed, as a trusted guide
            through implantation, operation, and maintenance with the host community and its partners.
            Some of the benefits for the community deploying Civitas – including one or more of the
            following: latest in 5G technology, advanced high efficiency lighting, and environmental sensors
            include:
            1. A critical infrastructure asset that the host community can control and exploit
            specifically for its unique needs, allowing for tighter control over service delivery
            roadmaps, deployment schedules, and financial (opex and capex) plans
            
            2. On service delivery roadmaps: The host community can elevate its most acute needs
            and bring every stakeholder that matters into the process
            
            3. On deployment roadmap: The host community and its stakeholder partners can,
            through their participation, be prepared to maximize their opportunity to not only
            provide input, but, extract value from the Civitas-enabled solutions
            
            4. On financial plans: The host community can position the Civitas investment with public
            and private sector stakeholders to capture maximum support, potential for ROI /impact
            and optimize access to capital at the lowest possible cost
            
            5. In summary, the host community can avoid the pitfalls of most of the recent failed
            attempts at financing the next generation of Cyber-physical infrastructure, diving
            meaningful impact with stakeholders, and materially enhancing quality of services, life
            and ultimately, the resilience of the host community.`
