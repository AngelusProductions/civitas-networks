            government wants to fund deployment. Yet no one has developed a plan for providing such
            service to the smaller communities throughout the country since it is not a lucrative
            proposition. Civitas Networks believes otherwise. It believes all communities should have
            access to the latest technology and its mission is to focus entirely on those communities being
            neglected and offer them a unique solution not readily available.
             Civitas’s unique approach to 5G fills the need for community’s looking for privacy,
            security, and a more useful network based on their needs on not the MNOs,
             5G private networks will improve a community’s way of life and bring new sources of
            revenue,
             Better looking and fitting equipment will ease deployment issues, enhancing the value
            of the community,
             Civitas works closely with the community to ensure their 5G and smart community
            needs are part of the equation.`

            content: `What is needed is a deeper understanding of the community’s goals, and then building a
            system around them. Civitas’ s customized, flexible Open Source 5G based wireless network
            supplies the community with not only reliable, secure, and high-speed data, but a whole host
            of sensors which enable the community to better understand their environment and adapt to
            the changing needs of their world.
            
            By employing a network of connected 5G transmitters along with IOT based sensors, the
            network not only brings a whole host of new services, but also collects and analyzes data for
            the community to use to improve infrastructure, public utilities, services, and more. The digital
            infrastructure of a smart city sets the stage for a network of partnerships all focused on one
            goal: Creating a smarter city. The result is an urban center that not only leverages technology to
            improve its own operations, but one that connects its citizens, businesses, and nonprofits in
            ways they’ve never experienced before. For example, retail market research and planning
            currently leans heavily on surveys. With a community-based sensor system, the information is
            already known. Community leaders can download and sort the data as needed.
            Our Focus is to support the Community, provide actionable data and measurable benefits,
            manage risk and resiliency, and enhance service.`

            latest in 5G technology, advanced high efficiency lighting, and environmental sensors with little
